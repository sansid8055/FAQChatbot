# Problem Statement: Mutual Fund FAQ Assistant (Facts-Only Q&A)

## Overview
Build a **facts-only FAQ assistant** for mutual fund schemes using **Groww** as the reference product context. The assistant should answer **objective, verifiable questions** about mutual funds by retrieving information exclusively from **official public sources** such as AMC websites, AMFI, and SEBI.

The system must **not provide investment advice**, opinions, or recommendations. Every response must include a **single clear source link** and adhere to strict clarity and compliance constraints.

## Objective

- Answers **factual queries** about mutual fund schemes
- Uses a **curated corpus of official documents**
- Provides **concise, source-backed responses**

---

## Target Users
- Retail investors comparing mutual fund schemes  
- Customer support and content teams handling repetitive MF queries

Refusal response should:

### 4. User Interface (Minimal)
Provide a simple UI with:
